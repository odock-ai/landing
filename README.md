# Odock.ai Landing

This repository hosts the Next.js marketing site and waitlist for [Odock.ai](https://odock.ai), the open-source unified API gateway for every LLM provider and MCP server. Odock issues virtual API keys, enforces budgets and security guardrails, routes requests with plugins and automatic failover—all through a single endpoint.

## What Odock.ai Delivers

- Unified interface across OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Bedrock, Vertex, Fireworks, vLLM, LM Studio, and MCP servers
- Virtual API keys with per-team quotas, rate limits, and audit trails
- Built-in AI firewall: prompt injection defense, jailbreak filtering, and data leakage protection
- Real-time budgets, token-level spend tracking, and adaptive routing/failover
- Extensible plugin engine for validation, transformations, and custom workflows
