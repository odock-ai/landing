    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is Odock.ai?",
        "answer": "Odock.ai is an open-source unified API gateway that lets you access all LLM providers and MCP servers through a single endpoint. It includes API key management, quotas, security guardrails, and an extensible plugin marketplace."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the unified API work?",
        "answer": "Instead of managing separate API keys and integrations for each provider, Odock.ai acts as a middleware. You send requests to Odock.ai, and we route them to your chosen provider(s) with automatic fallbacks if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do security guardrails function?",
        "answer": "Our security layer automatically detects and blocks prompt injections, prevents sensitive data leakage, enforces rate limits, and filters outbound data—all without configuration required."
      },
      {
        "question": "What providers are supported?",
        "answer": "We support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex, AWS Bedrock, Groq, Fireworks, and 50+ other LLM providers and MCP servers. New integrations are added regularly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are virtual API keys?",
        "answer": "Virtual API keys allow you to issue child keys for different teams, projects, or users without sharing your primary credentials. Each key can have custom quotas, rate limits, and audit trails."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the plugin system work?",
        "answer": "Plugins are middleware that execute sequentially or in parallel within the request pipeline. Build custom plugins for logging, webhooks, compliance checks, or any custom workflow."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Odock.ai open source?",
        "answer": "Yes! Odock.ai is fully open source under an MIT license. You can self-host, fork, or contribute to the project on GitHub."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does fallback routing work?",
        "answer": "You can configure primary and fallback providers. If your primary provider fails, requests automatically route to the backup provider without interrupting service."
      }
    ]
